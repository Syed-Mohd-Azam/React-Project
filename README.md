# 🎉 This project is about how we can change the color by giving the input value ❤️
In this project we used JavaScript with React with Vite bundler.
We learned about the props drilling, how we can pass the data from parents to the child.
Component Composition is used here and how two sibling components using the values from the parent component and so on.
# Hope you enjoyed the project.
